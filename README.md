# Final Project Inventory Transport Application

- This application's intended use is for a vehicle delivery company's admin to be able to submit their trips to their manually.

## Bugs/Missing

- Do not have a working authentication, I built the rest first and then could not get it placed correctly to work based on previous projects.
- Database was meant to be built around the submissions in the admin screen, but server is not reading even though it is not throwing any errors.
- Could not get deployment to work with 2 separate folders as a previous instructor recommended. Did not have enough time to research more as was trying to get functionality.

## Organization
- Front End contains all of the source code for the React application
- Back End contains all the source code for the Node.js server application and Authentication


## Getting started
- Clone the project locally
- Change into the Front End directory
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- In a different terminal
- Change into the Back End directory
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
